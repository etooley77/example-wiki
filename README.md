## DjangoBase
A starter project including login/registration for users and a mod system once you add a 'Moderators' group to the admin page.

# NOTE : Before you run the server, create a superuser, then log in to the admin page. Create a group called 'Moderators' to make sure you do not get any errors in your localhost.
